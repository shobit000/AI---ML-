#Credit Card Fraud Detection

##Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting credit card fraud. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions to mitigate risks and protect their customers.

##Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw transaction data to make it suitable for model training.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features that can help in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Model Training: Implementing and training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict fraudulent activities.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Generating visualizations to understand the data distribution and model performance.
